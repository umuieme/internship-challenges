## List me

### What you need to do?

* If you haven’t already, take a [git class in codeschool](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git).
* Once complete, create a private repo called “yipl-android-list-me”” in [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)
* Solve the problem detailed below
* Push your code to the repo (make sure that you have multiple commits with proper messages) 
* Invite internship-bitbucket@yipl.com.np to that particular private repo
* Submit your application

### Problem

Implement a simple listing and detail showcase application using the following APIs:

* For user listing: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/
* For user posts list: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/{user_id}/posts
* For post comments: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/{post_id}/comments

Checkout [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) for more details.

Once loaded, the data (both listing and detail) should persist. Any persistence mechanism can be used, i.e., cache or database. 
#### NOTE

* Design is important, but can be designed as you wish.
